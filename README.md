# ScreenTimeCounter
Something I did when I was bored during philosophy online classes. 

Lightweight screen time counter. 

 Be sure dll is in same folder as exe
 
# Usage 
Launch the exe and use your computer normally. If you're going idle, close the console to stop the capture. The app creates a shortcut of itself in the Startup folder so it runs on your computer startup unless you launch it with **-nostartuplaunch**

# How to get the time spent
ScreenTimeCounter.exe *enter argument here*

**argument:**
```
-day
-week
-month
-year
-total
-date *specific date* (format: mm-dd-yyyy -> example: 04-03-2020)
-count *number*  
-range *startDate*~*endDate*
```
