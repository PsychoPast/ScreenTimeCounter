# ScreenTimeCounter
Something I did when I was bored during philosophy online classes. 

Lightweight screen time counter. 

 Be sure dll is in same folder as exe
 
# Usage 
Launch the exe and use your computer normally. The app creates a scheduled task to run when the current user logs on unless you launch it with **-!registertaskschedule**.

# IdleTime
App automatically detect when you're idle and stop the capture. Default idleTime is 5 minutes (300000 milliseconds) which you can change to your own value (in milliseconds) by modiying "config.txt".

# How to get the time spent
ScreenTimeCounter.exe *enter argument here*

**argument:**
```
-day
-week
-month
-year
-total
-date *specific date* (format: mm-dd-yyyy -> example: 04-03-2020)
-count *number*  
-range *startDate*~*endDate*
```
