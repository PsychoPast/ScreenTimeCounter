# ScreenTimeCounter
Something I did when I was bored during philosophy online classes. 

Lightweight screen time counter. 

 Be sure dll is in same folder as exe
 
# Usage 
Launch the exe and use your computer normally.

# IdleTime
App automatically detect when you're idle and stop the capture. Default idleTime is 5 minutes (300000 milliseconds) which you can change to your own value (in milliseconds) by creating a "config.txt" in the same folder as the .exe and writing in it: **idleTime=your value in milliseconds**.

# How to get the time spent
ScreenTimeCounter.exe *enter argument here*

**argument:**
```
